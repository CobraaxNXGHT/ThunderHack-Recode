thunderhack recode for pojav launcher, 1.20.4
1.20.6 and 1.21 won't work due to the shader in the main menu, doesn't work with:
Holy GL4ES (not working at all, it's 2.1 so it's old)
Virgl Render (kinda works, you need this jvm arguement launch ) -> ( -noverify -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism )
ANGLE and Zink (I have no idea, my device doesn't have vulkan support, but it should work, I can't see why not.)



Obama :)



PS: I do not own this client, I only made it compatible for mobile launchers like PojavLauncher, FoldCraftLauncher and so on. So uhhhhh, enjoy!
